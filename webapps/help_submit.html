<br>- Species
<br>- Organ/Tissue (select from controlled vocabulary)
<br>- Image Name
<br>- Uploading of the Image</td></tr>
<tr><td class="bodytxbold" >Species</td><td class="bodytext">Select species from the drop down list. Depending on your selection the controlled vocabularies for organ/tissue and diagnosis are chosen. Please make sure that you select Species first before you fill in any of the other fields.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="bodytxbold" >Organ/Tissue</td><td class="bodytext">When you click the &quot;Select&quot; button next to the Organ/Tissue field a new browser window will open. Depending on your selection in the species drop-down list the vocabularies are populated. The vocabularies are presented in a tree-structure. Clicking on the folders will open them up and allow access to sub-terms. A term is selected by clicking on the hyperlinked name.<br>
You can also search for an organ/tissue by entering the word in the search field provided at the top left corner. The search results can be displayed in the vocabulary tree or directly selected by clicking on the hyperlinked name.<br>
Once you selected an organ/tissue it will be inserted in the corresponding field on the submission page and the window with the vocabulary tree will close automatically.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="bodytxbold">Diagnosis</td><td class="bodytext">When you click the &quot;Select&quot; button next to the Diagnosis field a new browser window will open and diagnoses specific for the selected organ will be displayed.<br> Clicking on the folders will open them up and allow access to sub-terms. A term is selected by clicking on the hyperlinked name.<br>
<b>Searching for a diagnosis pertaining to a specific organ</b><br>
You can also search for a diagnosis by entering the word in the search field provided at the top left corner. The search results can be displayed in the vocabulary tree or directly selected by clicking on the hyperlinked name. Please be aware that the search is only conducted in the part of the tree that is displayed on the right site. Once you select an organ/tissue it will be inserted in the corresponding field on the submission page and the window with the vocabulary tree will close automatically.
<br><b>Diagnosis not found. What next?</b><br>
If the manual search or automatic search did not retrieve the desired result you can display all diagnoses in the vocabulary. To search the complete vocabulary click on the "Show all diagnoses" arrow and search again by entering the word in the search field on the top left corner. The vocabularies are are structured by &quot;Diagnoses per Organ&quot;. Searching the complete diagnosis tree may return many results especially when you search for terms like &quot;adenocarcinoma&quot;, because this particular kind of tumor can arise in many organs. Verify the diagnosis by viewing it in the data tree. Once you select an organ/tissue it will be inserted in the corresponding field on the submission page and the window with the vocabulary tree will close automatically.<br>
<b>Diagnosis still not found? Entering a new diagnostic term.</b><br>
If none of the previously described searches retrieves a matching diagnostic term you can manually enter a diagnosis. A &quot;Submit&quot; button in the left bottom frame opens a new window which allow you to enter the missing term. This term will be forwarded to members of the vocabulary team who decide if this diagnosis will be included in the vocabulary.<br>
<b>Normal tissue</b><br>
Currently, the vocabulary does not contain information for normal tissue. Use the Image Description field to indicate that the image was taken from non-diseased tissue.
